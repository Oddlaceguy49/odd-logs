Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Contents

## Tests

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## Svelte Button Test

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

<Button class="w-auto h-auto" client:visible>
    <h1 class="m-0">HI</h1>
</Button>

## Code Example

```typescript:lib/mdx.ts
console.log("Wowie! Code title!")
```

```js
console.log("Yipee! No title!");
```

## Tests from MDsveX

Boinger

<Boinger color="orange" client:visible />

Counter

<Counter class="h-10" client:visible />

<p>
    <span class="inline-flex items-center gap-x-2">
        <span>Inlined Counter:</span>
        <Counter client:visible />
    </span>
</p>

hi: <Counter client:visible />
