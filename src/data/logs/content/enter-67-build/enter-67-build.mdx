Now is not a good time to own a keyboard with "67" inscribed on it :(

## Why am I doing this?

I've been using a laptop my entire life, and I have just now decided to build my first PC.
That means I need to buy peripherals. More shopping...
But wait!
I already own a mouse since I'm a pro gamer / 3D modeller, and I have this disassembled mechanical keyboard in my garage.
So I grabbed the keyboard off the shelf - wow this is heavy.

One quick price search later:
<h1 class="text-primary">$99.99</h1>

Now where did this come from? Please click this button below to enable the time machine:

"INSERT FLASHBACK SOUND HERE"

## OBJECTIVE: MAKE LOTS OF MONEY

Back in middle school, I used to "raise funds" by "distributing" candy at school, albeit with some added markup.
Yeah, I bought gas station candy below market value and sold it for an exorbitant 500% profit.
In my defense... I got nothing.

Anyways, I knew this kid who built mechanical keyboards as a hobby, and he was CONSTANTLY building these things.
He must have owned dozens of them.
Now since I sold candy, that also meant I had to collect debts and interest, and this guy was notorious for being years late on his debt.
Not just to me, but to a everybody he had ever owed.

We meet under the rafters of the courtyard.
The sun hides behind the clouds as the wind screams through the hallways. 
He asks to buy some Swedish Fish, I tell him $5; the standard price.
He doesn't have the money.

Before I can tell him I'm not letting him put it on credit, he casually offers up a mechanical keyboard.
Now, if somebody offers a mechanical keyboard for something that's worth $5 and was originally bought for 25 cents, they're clearly not thinking.

I kindly reminded him, "Dude, that's worth $100+ dollars."

"Yeah, I know."

What in the actual hell.

Doing some quick mental math, I calculated that the risk vs. reward was clearly in my favor, despite his history of outstanding debts.
And outstand his debts he did.
I didn't get this keyboard until then end of the year.
He also told me that he had broken one of the connections, so one of the key switches was permanently soldered in.
It was practically free though!

Wow, I have a mechanical keyboard now!
Time to test the RGB.

<p class="text-primary">BROKEN</p>

Or maybe I had flashed the keyboard wrong.
I'm not sure.

*Well, the rest of the keyboard still works, and I did get this for basically free.*
I forged onwards with the consolation that I had acquired a very expensive and niche piece of tech for the price of a gumball.
Who cares if it's broken!

Now I need to buy keycaps.
*Hmmm... these look quite underwhelming.*
And they cost a lot.

This was right around the time that I had purchased my first (and still only) functional 3D printer.
*I bet I could make one of these.*

A little life lesson: before inventing the wheel, check if it already exists.
As it turns out, someone had built an entire [keycap generator](https://github.com/riskable/keycap_playground/tree/master).
So I installed OpenSCAD, loaded up the generator, and... I have no clue how to use this thing.

After pouring 8 consecutive hours into trying to figure it out, I just quit.
Not my proudest moment, I know.
I banished my keyboard to my garage, and I never saw it again.

"BACK TO THE FUTURE BUTTON"

*There is this keyboard in my garage.
I am now more experienced with 3D printing.
I could really print these keycaps.*
